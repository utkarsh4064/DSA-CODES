sliding pointer concept in linkedlist:

take three pointers p,q and r. where p is initially at first, and q and r are at NULL, immediately following p. then run the loop from similar approach 
while(p!=NULL) {
  r=q;
  q=p;
  p=p->next;
  q->next=r;
     }

first=q;


//q plays the main role here by being the middle pointer.
